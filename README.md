# Python-Projects
- Python projects that I have created. Most of these projects are from a course created by Mike x Cohen
- Run the projects by copying the code and pasting it onto google colab.
- If the project doesn't load then go here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and then copy and paste the project url onto the search bar on the website. 
- Please have a look.

# Python-Projects
- Projects that I've made in python. They're mostly data analysis scripts along with a few programs that I have made. 
- If the project doesn't load then go here: [Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and then copy and paste the project url onto the search bar on the website.
- Please have a look. Click on a folder and choose a file with the ".ipynb" or ".py" extension.
